ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Dylan!

I'm currently in my senior year at Indiana University, studying Informatics with a minor in Web Development and Human-Centered Computing. My journey so far has been filled with a mix of tech exploration and hands-on projects, and I'm excited to share that I'm currently contributing to an AI application designed to help sales professionals level up their game.

ðŸŒ± A Bit About Me

I'm focused on learning and applying AI to real-world projects, with a strong interest in how technology can improve people's lives. I'm diving into topics like UI/UX design and full-stack development while sharpening my skills in JavaScript and React. Outside of coding, I enjoy gaming, hitting the gym, fishing, and snowboarding.
