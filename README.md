ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Dylan!

I'm currently in my senior year at Indiana University, studying Informatics with a minor in Web Development and Human-Centered Computing. My journey so far has been filled with a mix of tech exploration and hands-on projects, and I'm excited to share that I'm currently contributing to an AI application designed to help sales professionals level up their game.

ðŸŒ± A Bit About Me

I'm focused on learning and applying AI to real-world projects, with a strong interest in how technology can improve people's lives. I'm diving into topics like data analysis and full-stack development while sharpening my skills in JavaScript and React. Outside of coding, I enjoy gaming, hitting the gym, fishing, and snowboarding.

ðŸ’» What I'm Up To

Currently, I'm contributing to AI tools that help sales teams make informed decisions. I'm always looking for projects that let me learn new things, especially those related to AI, web development, or data-driven applications.
