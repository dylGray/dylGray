ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Dylan!

I'm currently in my senior year at Indiana University, studying Informatics with a minor in Web Development and Human-Centered Computing. 

ðŸŒ± A Bit About Me

I'm focused on learning and applying AI to real-world projects, with a strong interest in how technology can improve people's lives. I'm diving into topics like UI/UX design and front-end development while sharpening my skills in JavaScript, TypeScript, and React. Outside of coding, I enjoy gaming, hitting the gym, fishing, and snowboarding.
